# OpenIndustryProject

Free and Open-source PLC driven warehouse/manufacturing simulator made with [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine), [JoltPhysics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics), [OPC UA .NET](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard), and [libplctag](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag). 

The goal is to provide an open platform for developers to contribute to the creation of virtual industrial equipment/devices and for people to be able to test their ideas or simply educate themselves using a real PLC.
